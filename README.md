# GetGit

This app allows you to check your Github repos without visiting Github!

## To use
clone down the repo and `npm install` to download the packages
To start the app, use `npm start`

## Features
- search bar for Github user names
- returns a list of all public repos of the user with basic info about each repo
- direct clickable link to each repo
- click on a **repo description** *not* the hyperlink to see additional info about the repo without going to it

## Bug
Currently opens an additional container for each click, instead of just replacing data in the previous one
